# Travel Animation with HTML and CSS

This project showcases an animated travel scene created entirely using HTML and CSS. The animation features a bus moving across the screen with rotating wheels, a car following behind, and a detailed background to simulate a travel environment.

## Features

- **Pure CSS Animation:** The animation is crafted purely with CSS, demonstrating the power of keyframes, transforms, and transitions to bring a static design to life without relying on JavaScript.

- **Detailed Vehicle Design:** Both the bus and car are meticulously designed with `div` and `span` elements, mimicking real-life features like windows, doors, and wheels. The design emphasizes a playful yet realistic look, with color gradients, borders, and background images.

- **Responsive Background:** The background image is designed to fit the screen perfectly, providing a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Moving Bus:** The bus moves from left to right across the screen, simulating travel. The wheels rotate as the bus moves, adding to the realism.

- **Rotating Wheels:** The wheels of both the bus and car rotate continuously as they move along the road, thanks to the `rotate-wheel` animation.

## How It Works

The animation is controlled primarily through CSS keyframes:

- The `move-left` keyframe handles the horizontal movement of the bus across the screen.
- The `rotate-wheel` keyframe creates the rotation effect for the wheels, simulating real-world movement.

The layout is structured using nested `divs`, with careful attention to positioning, sizing, and layering to achieve the final design.
